textarea-backup
===============
This userscript retains what you type into textareas and contentEditable elements. It is only compatible with Opera 10.50 and up, but it should also work on GM with Fx 3.5 or higher.

Features:

1. Can automatically place previously typed text in textareas and contentEditable elements.
2. Can add an unobtrusive menu in the top right corner of textareas and contentEditable elements.
